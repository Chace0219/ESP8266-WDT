"gpus":"6","miner_instance":6,"
if miner instance is lower the GPU's it needs a reboot

I dont wanna do anything on the servers.
it has to be all on the panel, we cant run individual cronjobs on the servers(rigs)
cause It means updating and keeping track of that, which can be evaded by simply - reading the API, and having the remote panel "sudo hard-reboot" or "power cycle"

so its 2 events.
1 - Reboot if GPU is down or instance's are down
2 - power cycle of the server(rig) is responding to ping but wont allow ssh

I have servers that needs to be rebooted cause GPU crash, or cause "linux load is too high" those servers will respond to ping but are not working
